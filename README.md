# Iris Dataset Analysis and Model Building

## Introduction
This repository contains a complete data analysis and machine learning model-building pipeline on the famous **Iris dataset**. 
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks, containing 150 observations of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task is to classify the flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset.
2. Visualize the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
3. Build machine learning models to classify iris species.
4. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains the following columns:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**: Length of the sepal.
- **Sepal Width (cm)**: Width of the sepal.
- **Petal Length (cm)**: Length of the petal.
- **Petal Width (cm)**: Width of the petal.
- **Species**: Class label (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica).

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing or anomalous data.
   - Standardize or normalize features for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics.
   - Distribution analysis.
   - Pairwise relationships using scatterplots, correlation matrices, etc.
   - Visualizations using histograms, boxplots, and seaborn pairplots.

3. **Model Building**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Build multiple classification models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Precision, Recall, and F1-score
   - Compare model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for analysis.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning model building and evaluation.

## Results
- Summary of the best-performing model.
- Insights drawn from EDA and visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of data analysis and model building using a well-known dataset. 
The models built achieve good performance in classifying iris species, and the EDA reveals useful insights about feature relationships.
